# 5310 SQL Group Project

As a team of database experts, we are hired by a property company. The client has collected data on each house from multiple sources at different times. For example, data regarding room size and basic conditions are offered by builders, and data about the surroundings are collected by the property company. Moreover, customers will be exposed to a large amount of housing information data when choosing a house. At the same time, the client needs to access and analyze the properties more efficiently in their daily operations. Therefore, we would like to develop a relational database to manage unstructured data with a logical method. For instance, our team will divide the data into different groups based on their information types such as sales information, basement properties, neighborhood information, and other related data groups. There are other reasons to adopt a relational database. The relational database would be beneficial to reduce data redundancy, and are easy to backup and recover. The database would divide the original data into different segments, improving the security of managing data. Also, the database would make it easier to insert, update, and delete data. 


The dataset "train.csv" is originally from the Kaggle competition: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). 

You can find the schema of the relational database in "Schema&ImportData.Py." Using the code you can build a database in pgAdmin and write the tables to the database. 

"10Queries.sql" demonstrates the use of the relational databse.
